              <h3>Second TIdDLe Seminar (June 24th, 2022)</h3>
              <p>
                After the long pause due to the COVID restrictions, we are very glad to finally have our second seminar! We will kick off with a double presentation from Bhavin Choksi and Milad Mozafari about their paper "Predify: Augmenting deep neural networks with brain-inspired predictive coding dynamics". The presentation will revolve around their latest <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/75c58d36157505a600e0695ed0b3a22d-Paper.pdf">work</a> published last year at NeurIPS, about introducing brain-inspired dynamics in a deep network to improve their robustness to noise and adversarial attacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                 It will take place the 24th of June from at 16:00 on the 24 of June, in Salle des Thèses (C002) of INP-ENSEEIHT. The main entrance is located at 2 rue Charles Camichel (quarter Saint-Aubin). Visitors should press the bell/button "Accueil" and inform the welcoming desk of the purpose of the visit (attendance of the seminar). Room C002 is located in building C, ground-floor. Everybody is welcome to join! After the presentation, we will move the discussion to the closest bar for a deepBeer!

                <p>
                  Did you want to go to NeurIPS but couldn't make it this year? No problem, we're here to help... Toulouse Data Science and TIdDLe are co-organizing a one-day <b>NeurIPS meetup</b> (officially approved by the NeurIPS organizers). The event will take place on <i>December 16th, in the Auditorium of the Village By Ca </i> (31 allées Jules Guesdes, close to Palais de Justice). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Registration is free and open to anyone</strong>, but the number of participants is limited. If you wanted to join but didn't register yet, you may still email <a href="mailto:andrea.alamia@cnrs.fr?Subject=NeurIPS%20meetup%20registration">andrea.alamia@cnrs.fr</a> to make a request, we'll try our best to accommodate you. Similarly, if you registered but finally won't be able to come, please let us know so we can offer your spot to somebody else.

                <h3>First TIdDLe Seminar (Dec 2nd, 2019)</h3>
                <p>
                    The first seminar will take place the 2nd of December from 14:30 to 15:30 at the IRIT Auditorium in the Paul Sabatier Campus. We will have two speakers, and each presentation will last 20 minutes plus an additional 10 minutes for questions. Everybody is welcome to join!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The speakers are Bhavin Choksi from CerCo who will present his current work on biologically inspired neural networks, and Vincent Roger from IRIT who will provide an overview about few-shot learning techniques.

                <h3>First DeepBeer (Nov 18th, 2019)</h3>
                <p>
                    It was the right time to turn on our TIdDLe community! A good starter to get to know each other with a very informal event: our first DeepBeer meeting at Le Pery (https://www.lepery.com/).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea of the Deep Beer Meeting is to have a monthly event which gathers Tiddle members in front of a (few) beer(s). It's informal, fun and with variable location! The goal is to get to know each other without necessarily talking about Deep things. Everyone is welcome to join, so feel free to spread the invitation to friends and colleagues!

              <p>
                Our inaugural meeting took place at the B612 "Aerospace Valley" building on February 7th, 2019.
              <img src="img/TIdDLe_meeting1.jpg" alt="tiddle meeting schedule" style="float:left;width:350px;padding-top:12px;padding-right:20px"> 	
              About 80 permanent researchers from academia and industrial partners registered to the event. <br><br>
                We had plenty of general discussions, before, after and during the 16 scientific presentations.
              Group organization issues were discussed, ideas for future events, and modes of operation (including 
              the present website and the list of members expertise with contact info). 
                <br><br>
              The final cocktail was much appreciated, especially the apple cider.
